                <h2>The Back Story</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) is a global phenomenon
                  and Malawi is no exception. The 2015/16 Malawi Demographic and
                  Health Survey found&nbsp;that 34% of the women aged 15-49
                  reported experiencing physical violence, 14%&nbsp;experienced
                  sexual violence while 23% experienced emotional violence
                  within the&nbsp;12 months period prior to the survey (National
                  Statistical Office, 2017). In&nbsp;Malawi there are also a
                  number of traditional practices that prevent women
                  and&nbsp;girls from fully realizing their sexual and
                  reproductive health and rights&nbsp;(SRHR) as well as other
                  human rights.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In Malawi, the prevalence of traditional practices such as
                  child marriage and sexual initiation rituals has basically
                  remained unchanged over the last 15 years, even though those
                  have been falling globally at fast paces. 40% of all women who
                  had ever experienced any type of physical or sexual violence
                  sought help to stop violence (National Statistical Office,
                  2017); 49% never sought any help nor informed anyone about the
                  violence they had experienced.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Amongst those who sought help, 62% of the women reported that
                  they sought help from their own families, 33% from their
                  husbands’ families, 10% from their friends and only 10% sought
                  help from the police (National Statistical Office, 2017).
                  While various efforts have been made to address VAWG in
                  Malawi, progress has, however, been slow. More efforts are,
                  therefore, required in order to address SGBV, harmful
                  practices and other SRHR issues affecting women and girls.
                  Fight AIDS Malawi knows that the elimination of VAWG can be
                  achieved by effectively addressing the prevailing gender and
                  socio-cultural norms in communities.<br />
                </p>
                <h2>Our Response to End VAWG Programme</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM in addressing VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) has
                  adopted a human rights-based and integrated approach with a
                  goal of eradicating VAWG against girls and women. The
                  programme aims at ending the HIV epidemic among girls and
                  women. FAM is strengthening individual and community
                  capacities to address harmful norms and cultural practices
                  that inhibit individual rights and leave adolescent girls and
                  women vulnerable to transactional sex. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The FAM programme addresses relationships of power imbalances
                  and situations of physical and mental vulnerability. The main
                  components programme approach includes advocacy, capacity
                  building, strengthening legal protections and challenging male
                  stereotypes by engaging men, boys and chiefs in promoting
                  girls and women rights. FAM vision under this programme is to
                  see the societies where girl and women are fully empowered to
                  defend themselves from human rights violation and live a life
                  of dignity. <br />
                </p>
                <h2>Our Principles on Ending VAWG</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM adheres to the following principals in combating VAWG.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Intersectional approach to violence against women and girls
                  (VAWG). FAM includes a consideration of where gender
                  intersects with other inequalities oppressions (sexuality,
                  gender identity, ethnicity, indigeneity, immigration status,
                  disability, poverty and illiteracy) to produce unique
                  experiences of violence. FAM understands the different ways in
                  which violence is perpetrated and experienced, an
                  intersectional lens that help the organization to develop
                  appropriate specific interventions or responses when
                  addressing VAWG. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM put an intersectional approach into practice means going
                  beyond analysis to disrupt the structures, systems and power
                  relations that create and reinforce the inequalities that
                  maintain women’s and girls’ compounded vulnerabilities to
                  violence (e.g. transforming social norms, addressing
                  discriminatory structures). FAM also requires transforming
                  underlying socio-structural systems to address root causes
                  that currently make some women and girls more vulnerable to
                  violence. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM ensures resilience and sustainability in a rapidly
                  changing and complex environment is crucial in order to ensure
                  sustained transformational change and facilitate quick
                  adaptation and recovery from challenging situations. FAM
                  strengthening organisation resilience includes ongoing
                  monitoring and risk assessment, developing risk mitigation
                  plans and contingency measures factored into project design.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM develops adaptive and flexible programming methodologies
                  (i.e. moving online, alternative arrangements for access and
                  inclusivity in crisis situations), integration of measures to
                  prevent backlash and resistance, partnerships with other
                  CSOs/WROs to maintain community reach even through crises,
                  measures to ensure sustainability of project results, and
                  enhanced efforts to ensure organizational capacity. <br />

                <h2>Our Approach in Eliminating GENDER BASED VIOLENCE</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM in contributing to eliminate VAWG in Malawi has adopted
                  the following approaches.<br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Human rights-based approach that places paramount priority
                    on promoting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights of
                    all women and girls. A human rights-based approach requires
                    developing the capacities of ‘duty-bearers and ‘rights-
                    holders’.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enhancement of a survivor-centered and girls and women’s
                    empowerment approach that integrates women’s and girls’ own
                    experiences and inputs within all initiatives and strategies
                    as an essential part of successful programming. A
                    survivor-centered approach is fundamental to the protection
                    and promotion of the human rights of women and girls
                    affected, and to their empowerment.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Operating under ethical guidelines that ensure interventions
                    and services prioritize, and guarantee women’s and girls’
                    rights to safety and security, confidentiality and privacy,
                    expression of opinion and autonomy to make decisions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensuring gender responsiveness and transformative approaches
                    that seek to create or strengthen equitable gender norms and
                    dynamics for fundamental, lasting changes for women and
                    girls.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Employing culturally and contextually relevant entry points
                    through interventions that involve cultural, community,
                    faith-based, youth and other leaders.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Addressing specific forms and settings of VAWG through a
                    clear understanding of specific contexts in which violence
                    takes place for effective programme design and
                    implementation, with knowledge about specific forms,
                    settings, and population groups affected.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Adopting an intersectional approach and focusing on groups
                    most at risk of being left behind especially excluded or
                    disadvantaged women and girls (such as women and girls with
                    disabilities, LBT, internally displaced and refugees,
                    indigenous, older and members of ethnic minorities).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Operating within a socio-ecological model of understanding
                    violence which aims to ensure that interventions consider
                    and address the conditions across different levels (e.g.
                    individual, family, community and society), which affect
                    women and girls’ risks of experiencing violence.
