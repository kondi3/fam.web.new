                <h2>The Back Story</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In Malawi, despite significant progress, the number of children becoming newly infected with HIV remains
                  unacceptably high. High numbers of children living with HIV and pregnant women remain unaware of their
                  HIV status and not able to start and continue HIV treatment. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  When diagnosed with HIV, often very late, they are lost along the HIV treatment cascade, either before
                  or after being enrolled into HIV care and having started treatment. Children with HIV and pregnant
                  mothers remain undiagnosed for HIV because they are simply not known to the Health System.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Evidence shows that compared with older HIV-infected women, HIV-infected adolescent girls have lower
                  uptake of vertical transmission prevention services, are more likely to transmit HIV to their infants
                  and are more likely to disengage from postpartum HIV care.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In Malawi, uptake of health services for HIV exposed infants remain low. Diagnosis of paediatric HIV
                  remains a challenge leading to lower proportion of children living with HIV who start antiretroviral
                  therapy (ART) compared with adults.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Data shows that regular HIV testing, treatment, monitoring and care for children living with HIV can
                  enable them to live long and fulfilling lives. However, lack of necessary investment and resources for
                  adequate testing, paediatric ARVs and poor child-friendly prevention mean children disproportionately
                  suffer consequences of the HIV epidemic. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>What Fight Aids Malawi is Doing</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Fight AIDS Malawi projects are addressing persistent problems and challenges and needs of children
                  living with HIV and their mothers. In rural villages across Malawi, children aged 0-14 years are left
                  behind in HIV care. Multiple challenges prevent children and pregnant and lactating women from accessing
                  HIV vertical transmission prevention services. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>Community Level Challenges</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Household and community challenges include long distances to Clinics, lack of means to cover transport
                  to Clinics or to ensure good nutrition, limited knowledge about HIV prevention and treatment, stigma and
                  low male involvement. In Health Facilities, caregivers are overburdened and not sufficiently trained to
                  provide child-friendly services. HIV-negative new mothers at high-risk of HIV are insufficiently tested
                  while breastfeeding. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>The Current Situation</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  District Health Offices (DHO) data from the districts FAM is working highlight persistent problems.
                  Among children and adolescents living with HIV, 64% have been diagnosed and 52% are receiving ART.
                  <br />
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Evidence shows that Failure to test children and their mothers to put them on HIV treatment result in
                  children and Adolescents Living with HIV (ALHIV) to have worse ART adherence, lower rates of viral load
                  suppression and lower retention in HIV care.
                  <br />
                </p>

                <h2>Data Driven Programming</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In 2020, Ministry of Health estimated that 92% of HIV-positive pregnant women were initiated on ART
                  across many districts in Malawi. 74% were retained in HIV care at 12 months postpartum.<br />
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Data shows that high attrition in vertical HIV prevention programs is more of Loss to Follow-Up (LTFU)
                  than of mortality. Children born to women living with HIV and their mothers are missing out on
                  life-saving treatment as they are not systematically monitored and followed up during the postpartum
                  period. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>Fight Aids Malawi Experience and Past Results</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Fight AIDS Malawi has experience with the implemention of community-based paediatric HIV interventions.
                  With ViiV Healthcare Positive Action funding, 2016-2019, FAM implemented STOP-HIV project. STOP-HIV
                  improved blood sample collection and results delivery. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  STOP-HIV improved access to Early Infant Diagnosis for 1, 890 HIV positive children. STOP-HIV supported
                  1, 644 ALHIV and 1, 220 WLHIV to initiate and stay on treatment. FAM is scaling up STOP-HIV in Dowa
                  district with ViiV healthcare Positive Action funding, 2021-2025. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  With Partners in Rights funding, 2019-2022, FAM implemented Healthy Infant Tracking System (HITSystem).
                  HITSystem improved ART monitoring. Using electronic tracking, HITSystem traced 2, 650 WLHIV for ART
                  refills and viral load tests. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM previous experience has shown lack of awareness of the relationship between HIV and disability
                  amongst health professionals and the public, with little networking and sharing of experience. These
                  challenges result in inadequate treatment for ALHIV with disabilities. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM will apply these lessons by integrating Tingathe (We can Do It) Guidance Package for integrating
                  children’s and adolescents’ needs living with disability into HIV care. The Guidance Package will
                  comprise HIV Care Manuals, Tools and Resources. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  HIV Care Manuals will be used by CHW, caregivers, clinicians, rehabilitation technicians, disability
                  programme officers, school teachers, community volunteers and parents to raise awareness, increase
                  disability identification and bridge gaps between service providers and ALHIV. <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Tools and Resources section will assist CHW, caregivers and physicians to screen children for
                  disabilities. Educational resource centres will be listed along with available service providers and
                  resource institutions for referrals and placement. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>The Fight AIDS Malawi approach aims to find, test, and treat, children and mothers and support them to
                  stay in care.</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  To find children and mothers, CHWs will move door to door to provide counseling for women to understand
                  benefits of HIV testing, identify pregnant women not knowing their HIV status and motivate them for
                  testing.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  To provide HIV testing, CHWs educates community members on paediatric HIV, provide couple counselling
                  and find HIV positive pregnant women. CHW will conduct door-to door HIV counseling, test pregnant women
                  and children in homes or refer them for testing in clinics.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Trained CHW and Mother Mentors regularly tests HIV-negative new mothers at high-risk of HIV while
                  breastfeeding. CHW will provide couple counseling to HIV negative women and new mothers and their HIV
                  positive partners on benefits of and access to PrEP to protect their baby from getting HIV during
                  pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  To provide HIV treatment, CHAI integrates DSD for providing adolescent dedicated clinical consultations.
                  DSD will deliver TB, mental health, substance abuse and adherence risk screening and support for
                  children in designated spaces and on special days. <br />
                </p>

                <h2>How Fight AIDS Malawi Meaningfully Involves Target Groups</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Fight AIDS Malawi projects follow rights-based approaches to project design and implementation. FAM
                  meaningfully involves ALHIV, pregnant and lactating mothers and WLHIV at every stage of LIFE
                  implementation. During project design, a human focused approach are used to involve ALHIV and pregnant
                  and lactating women in needs assessments, suggesting of solutions and prioritization of interventions.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Project Scale up Surveys engage ALHIV and women who benefited from previous interventions. Disability
                  needs activists were involved and they helped to engage ALHIV and WLHIV living with disabilities to
                  ensure their needs are included.<br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM integrates feedback mechanisms incorporated in project design. Beneficiaries’ meaningful engagement
                  will continue during project implementation. Monthly Progress Meetings, Project Satisfaction Surveys
                  (PSS), In-depth Interviews, Beneficiary Expectations Forums, will be used to collect feedback from
                  children’s caregivers, ALHIV and WLHIV, community members and families.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM projects are flexible and able to adapt to changing contexts and the needs of benefiting pregnant
                  and lactating women, WLHIV and ALHIV. Once feedback is collected, an analysis of the feedback and how
                  FAM proposes to respond to it will be conducted. The collected feedback will be immediately addressed. A
                  report will be compiled and shared with everyone who provided feedback.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Fight AIDS Malawi involves communities through inclusive decision making. FAM Paediatric HIV Advisory
                  Unit (PAU) will ensure meaningful inclusion of community responses that will address priority needs of
                  ALHIV and WLHIV.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Fight AIDS Malawi use these mechanisms of beneficiary Feedback to increase and integrate a rights-based
                  approach, increase transparency and ensure accountability to communities and beneficiaries. This will
                  lead to project ownership and sustainability.
                  <br />
                </p>

                <h2>Fight Aids Malawi Community Strengthening Approach</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  To strengthen community structures, FAM will implement Community Systems Strengthening (CSS) approach.
                  With CSS, projects capacitate schools and churches with improved knowledge and skills to support WLHIV
                  and ALHIV.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  CSS will engage teachers, community leaders and peer mothers as resource persons to educate communities
                  to improve familial and social support for WLHIV and ALHIV. Tingathe Guidance Package will guide
                  addressing needs of WLHIV and ALHIV with disabilities.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Family to Family (FtF) model is embedded into CSS to address stigma in families and create supportive
                  environments for ALHIV and WLHIV. FtF CHW will trace children and WLHIV. FtF will regularly test HIV
                  negative lactating mothers, provide PrEP and couple counseling for their HIV positive partners to stay
                  on treatment.
                  <br />
                </p>

                <h2>How Fight Aids Malawi Strengthens Community Clinic Collaborations</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  FAM Projects address challenges of poor coordination between community structures and Health Facilities.
                  In every new area where we work, needs assessments are done to understand the gaps in community clinic
                  collaboration.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Based on needs assessments, Community Clinic Collaboration (C3) methodologies are integrated. Capacity
                  building in C3 management and formalized meetings between communities and Clinics are introduced to
                  improve coordinated planning and sharing.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  With integrated C3 methodologies, communities and Clinics are capacitated to reach and sustain pregnant
                  women, children and adolescents in care. Clinics and communities will act together to increase uptake,
                  link children and families into care, combat stigma and discrimination, monitor programme quality, and
                  build stronger local health systems.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The C3 methodologies transform structured clinic and community relationships. C3 tools provided
                  necessary capacity-building for addressing health facility stigma and joint monitoring and
                  co-ordination.

                  Fight AIDS Malawi has experience of successfully working with subgrantees in implementing community
                  paediatric HIV projects. From 2019 to 2021, FAM led twelve Community Based Organizations in implementing
                  READY+ project with a budget of €950,000 funded by Partners in Rights. READY+ expanded access to HIV
                  testing and treatment to 2, 689 pregnant women and 2, 780 children.
                  <br />

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In 2016-2019, FAM led a consortium of 4 partners to implement STOP-HIV project. The consortium was
                  funded by ViiV Healthcare Positive Action and National AIDS Commission, with a budget of £440,000. The
                  consortium collectively expanded access to HIV services for pregnant women, children and adolescents
                  aged 0-14 years.
